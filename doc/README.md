Primecoin High Performance Version
==================================

This is the high performance version of Sunny King's Primecoin tree.

Features:
 * Extended sieve algorithm
 * Cache-friendly segmented sieve
 * Adjustable sieve parameters
 * Mining threads use GMP for faster bignum arithmetic

Donations are welcome if you want to support my work.

Sieve parameters
----------------

 * -sievesize determines how many numbers go through the sieve in one go. The
default value is 1 million. This value has very little impact on performance.

 * -sievefilterprimes determines how many primes factors will be filtered out
by the sieve. The default value is 7849. This value has a minor impact on
performance.

 * -sieveextensions determines the number of sieve "extensions". Each extension
will effectively process an additional set of numbers through the sieve
relatively cheaply. The default value is 9. This value has a minor impact on
performance.

 * -l1cachesize determines the sieve segment size (in bytes). This should be
the size of the L1 or L2 cache (or some other number close to them). The
default value is 28000. This value has a minor impact on mining performance.

 * -primorial determines the primorial that is used as a multiplier in all
candidate numbers. This should a small prime number such as 47 or 53. Use the
parameters -debug -printprimorial to see which primorials are used by default.
This value has a minor impact on mining performance.

Some parameters can be changed on the fly using the following RPC commands:
 * setsievefilterprimes
 * setsievesize
 * setsieveextensions

Old and removed parameters:
 * -sieveroundpercentage
 * -sievepercentage

Intro
---------------------
Primecoin is a free open source cryptocurrency that implements the first
scientific computing proof-of-work for cryptocurrencies. The unique
proof-of-work design searches for rare prime formations, providing
experimental value for mathematicians to further understand the nature and
distribution related to prime number, a simple yet mysterious construct of
arithmetic that continues to baffle the top minds of mankind.

Upgrade
--------------------
First backup wallet. Then follow setup instructions. Double check balance
after completing setup and starting up client.

Setup
--------------------
You need the Qt4 run-time libraries to run Primecoin-Qt. On Debian or Ubuntu:
        `sudo apt-get install libqtgui4`

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- bin/32/primecoin-qt (GUI, 32-bit)
- bin/32/primecoind (headless, 32-bit)
- bin/64/primecoin-qt (GUI, 64-bit)
- bin/64/primecoind (headless, 64-bit)

Intro
---------------------
Bitcoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.


Setup
---------------------
You need the Qt4 run-time libraries to run Bitcoin-Qt. On Debian or Ubuntu:
	`sudo apt-get install libqtgui4`

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- bin/32/bitcoin-qt (GUI, 32-bit)
- bin/32/bitcoind (headless, 32-bit)
- bin/64/bitcoin-qt (GUI, 64-bit)
- bin/64/bitcoind (headless, 64-bit)
